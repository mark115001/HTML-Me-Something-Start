                Set sale on the Ruby Princess from San Fransciso Bay, Ca., Pier
                27. This was the beginning of three days of sailing before
                reaching the first port in Skagway, Alaska. However, four hours
                into the cruise, a passenger medical emergency occurred and the
                ship had to return to San Fransicso where the passenger was
                picked up by the US Coast Guard.I believe I heard the passenger
                was OK. Since sailing to Skagway was 8 hours behind, the ship
                could not reach the port as scheduled so we headed for what was
                supposed to be our third destination. It was not a port. It was
                a Glacier in the Endicott Arm inlet.

              <p>
                Sailing into Endicott Arm inlet to reach the Dawes Glacier took
                more than an hour. We were sailing in between mountains through
                the very deep fjords that were created by glaciers over the
                millennia of time. The water was completely calm except for
                what the ship was creating. The picture to the left is the Dawes
                Glacier. This glacier has been losing water and that can be seen
                in the small chunks of ices that are shown floating away. The
                most interesting part was that the ship's captain wanted to give
                all three thousand-plus passengers a good view of the glacier so
                he maneuvered the ship into the middle of the fjord and then
                spun the ship 360 degrees so every passenger had great view of
                the glacier and could get all the pictures they wanted. Then we
                traveled out of Endicott Arm and on to the first port in
                Skagway, Alaska.

                We ate lunch on the first floor of the Red Onion bar and grill.
                This bar has been around since the gold rush days and while it's
                always been a bar or saloon, downstairs,upstairs are where the
                "ladies of the evening" worked. The waitresses were dressed like
                the "ladies" used to be when then upstairs was not just a
                showplace like it is today. At any rate, the food was good and
                the place was absolutely packed, likely because of the ship but
                also there were not many places to eat. The main thing we did in
                Skagway was to go see where they trained the Iditarod sled dogs.
                There was obviously no snow but they still pulled sleds and
                learned to work together. We took a sled ride and then got to
                meet and pet the dogs that pulled our sled. Then we went and
                looked at the puppies that would eventually become sled dogs.
                Before going back to the ship we walked down the main street
                bought some kettle corn and headed back to the ship. Next stop
                Juneau, Alaksa.

                We had enough time in Juneau to do two things. Right after we
                arrived, we got on a bus to head out on another boat to look for
                humpback whales. That's actually why I alwayswanted to take a
                cruise to Alaska, to see whales. I didn't know really anything
                else to do in Alaska but I wanted to see whales so we signed up
                for an excusion out into to thelocal Juneau waters with a
                guarentee to either see whales or get our money back. There were
                about 30 to 40 people on this smaller boat and we sailed out
                about 15 to 20 minutes from shore and then kind of just stopped.
                The captain announced he had seen whales on the starboard(right)
                side and we all started looking. It's really funny to see 30 or
                40 people move to one side of the boat at the same time but the
                captain was correct, we saw a cloud of air forcefully expelled.
                The captain said we found a group of about 10 whales of all ages
                but you really can't tell how big a whale your looking at is
                with just a blowhole but no matter what age it was, we got to
                see what we paid for. We even saw one whale divebreach and we
                saw its dorsal fins but it was just one time. After that
                successful excursion, we were driven to another glacier. The
                Mendenhall Glacier. This glacier was much bigger than the Dawes
                Glacier that we sway a couple of days earlier but as you can see
                in the picture to the left, a large piece had broken off
                recently and left the rock exposed. There was one other amazing
                feature at this glacier and that was a huge waterfall from the
                melting snow from the end of the winter season. After this we
                were bussed back to the Ruby Princess and we set off for our
                next stop, Ketchikan, Alaska.

              <p>
                Right after arrival, we attended a lumberjack show. It was
                absolutely amazing to watch the competion on 5 differnt
                challenges. Pole climbing, wood chopping, ax throwing, log
                rolling and I don't recall the fifth one. These were skills
                needed when logging was still occurring in Alaska and Canada.
                Logging was very dangerous and it was evident with the tests
                they were doing. Learning about Skagway on a small boat cruise
                was also amazing. First we were able to see up close a pair of
                blad eagles. Their nest was huge. The boat captain said the
                "couple", who almost always mate for life, add on to the nest
                each year. The cruise went past a row of houses that were next
                to the lake. We were told there was no running water in this
                area and that all water for bathing and cleaning came from rain
                water. As a result, every house not only had a boat but they
                also had a storage tank tocatch the rain. There is tens of feet
                of rain in this region yearly. Next, we say a house with totem
                poles where native Tlingit families lived. There were mutiple
                generations in one house that rarely had more than a few rooms
                and everyone in the family lived there. The families also built
                totem poles that told about the family that lived there. Most of
                these houses were no longer in use but the totem poles were
                still there. Then we found out that all children not only learn
                how to drive a boat when they are very young so they can take
                themselves to school but they have to go on supervised survival
                training when they are in their teens. They are only given one
                item, can't recall what that was, but everything they needed to
                live and start a fire needed to be in that one item. Next we
                headed on to the final destination, the only Canada stop, Prince
                Rupert, British Columbia.

              <p>
                We were only at this port for about 3 hours. We had to have
                passports with us when we left the ship although we were never
                asked for it while there. The first thing we saw was an RCMP,
                Royal Canadian Mounted Policeman in full red and black uniform
                and hat, just like I've always seen on TV. He posed for pictures
                with passengers. The big thing at this port was I needed to buy
                a new razor. Mine broke and we were still more than three days
                from San Francisco so I needed to purchase a new one.
                Fortunately, after speaking with an very kind lady about Prince
                Rupert and Canadian health care, she pointed up to a WalMart
                where I was able to purchase a new razor. Once back on the ship,
                we settled in for the final three days of sailing before
                arriving back in San Francisco, Pier 27.

                Back aboard the ship, we did the same things we did for the
                first three days of the cruise, eat and try to find some shows
                that passed the time. Honestly, there was not really enough
                sailing time for me as I marveled at the sunsets and the
                vastness of the ocean which I new was the case but could never
                really put it into perspective until now. I was glad to be
                headed home but I could not and still can't get over Alaska. I
                truly want to go back and visit one of the ports we were at,
                probably Juneau first, but there are also other port cities that
                were not on this cruise that I like to see sometime although
                anywhere in Alaska where I could get up every day and see the
                beauty of the mountains or the ocean would be amazing. I never
                would have done this myself but I have to give my daughter
                another huge thank you for taking me on what has turned out to
                be the best vacation I've ever experienced.
